Project Overview:
This Java Web Application allows users to manage student profiles stored in a database. Users can fill out a form with personal information, which is processed by a Servlet and saved to the database, then displayed dynamically on a JSP page. This project demonstrates the Servlet-JSP MVC architecture with database integration.

Features:

1. HTML form to collect user data: Name, Student ID, Program, Email, Hobbies, and Short Introduction

2. Servlet (ProfileServlet) for processing submissions and interacting with the database

3. JSP (viewProfiles.jsp) to display all profiles with search, filter, edit and delete functionality
